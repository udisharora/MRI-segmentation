# MRI-segmentation
This project segments brain tumors in MRI images using a U-Net model. It involves preprocessing multimodal MRI scans, converting them to tensors, and training the model for accurate tumor detection. Key steps include loading, normalizing data, applying transformations, and evaluating model performance using accuracy and Dice coefficient metrics.
